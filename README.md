## 🚀 Vision & Challenge Alignment: PTIB Civic Tech Challenge 2025
**Amar Adalat (আমার আদালত - My Court/Justice)** is our direct response to the **PTIB Civic Tech Challenge 2025**, embodying the spirit of enhancing public participation, transparency, and accountability through technology.  

Our core motive is to **democratize access to legal information and justice resources** in Bangladesh, directly addressing the challenge's **"Legal & Justice Access"** theme.  

Millions in Bangladesh face barriers to justice due to lack of awareness, complex legal procedures, and limited access to legal aid. Amar Adalat aims to dismantle these barriers by providing an intuitive, accessible, and comprehensive digital platform that empowers citizens with knowledge and connects them to essential services.  

This project is dedicated to fostering a more **Tolerant, Inclusive Bangladesh** where **legal literacy is a right, not a privilege**.
